				<p>Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) are a major cause of death globally, leading to  around 1.25 million deaths annually. Transport authorities
					 worldwide have been striving to implement strategies to minimize RTAs by introducing various safety regulations. However, RTA reduction
					 has proven to be an elusive goal as these measures have hitherto failed to make a considerable dent in the frequency of RTA.</p>

				<p>This failure partially stems from the difficulty in predicting when and where RTAs may occur. Although difficult, such prediction is
					not impossible. RTAs do not occur in purely stochastic manner; several publications affirm that the probability of RTAs is influenced 
					by multitude of measurable factors. These factors include obvious ones such as driving speed, traffic condition, road structure and 
					weather to less obvious ones such as national mood and lunar cycle.</p>

				 <p>In an effort to reduce RTA frequency, various municipal and national governments in the USA have made available rich datasets of RTAs 
					 and their associated factors. We have explored these datasets and discovered factors that correlate well with RTA probability. Using 
					 this observation, we have created a machine learning model that predicts with high accuracy as to when and where RTAs are likely to 
					 occur.  </p>

				<h1 class="major">Datasets and Research Methodology:</h1>
				<p>The main dataset we used for this project is the one retrieved from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accd from February 2016 tidents">Kaggle.</a>
					This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data are collected Dec 2020, 
					using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety 
					of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within
					the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3 million accident records in this dataset. Check here to learn more about this dataset.</p>


				<p> US-Accidents can be used for numerous applications such as real-time car accident prediction, studying car accidents hotspot locations,
					casualty analysis and extracting cause and effect rules to predict car accidents, and studying the impact of precipitation or other 
					environmental stimuli on accident occurrence. The most recent release of the dataset can also be useful to study the impact of COVID-19
					on traffic behavior and accidents. </p>

				<p style="clear:both">Upon exploring our cleaned dataset, we made several interesting observations. These observations are elaborated below.</p>

				<p style="clear:left"><b><i>What day is road traffic accidents most likely to occur? </b></i></p>
				<p>The plot shows that highest number of accidents occured Wednesday and lowest number are reported on Sunday.</p>


				<p style="clear:both"> </p>

				<iframe src="{{ url_for('main.weather_info') }}" name="iframe_b" style="height:550px;width:850px;border: 2px steelblue solid;padding:

				<p style="clear:right;margin-left: 15px"><b><i>On which weather, most of the accidents happened? </b></i>

				<p>In the dataset, almost 128 differnent weather conditions are reported. From the plot, it is shown clear that most of the accidents 
					occured when the weather was fair and second highest when the weather was clear. </p>

					<p style="clear:left"><b><i>What are the top 10 states with the highest number of accidents?</b></i></p>
					<p> The bar graph on the right shows the distribution of accidents based on the top 10 states.
						It shows that most accidents happened in Housten State with almost 110k cases.</p>
